    "The announcement made on Friday by OpenAI indicated that the board had lost faith in Altman's capability to steer the company effectively. According to a statement released on the company's blog, the decision for this \"leadership transition\" came after a thorough review process by the board, which found Altman's approach to communicating with them as lacking in transparency, thereby impeding their governance role.\n",

    "The tech sector has been abuzz with reactions to this surprising news. Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, praised Altman on X, likening him to a \"hero\" who profoundly impacted the world. Greg Brockman, President of OpenAI and co-founder alongside Altman and Elon Musk, announced his resignation following the revelation of Altman's dismissal. \n",

    "Altman rose to prominence with the release of ChatGPT last year, a tool that enthralled and concerned the public with its advanced, human-like responses, although not always accurate. His influence in the tech industry has been significant, with comparisons drawn to J Robert Oppenheimer by New York Magazine and recognition in Time Magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in AI in 2023.\n",
